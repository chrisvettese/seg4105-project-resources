The algorithm takes place in a few steps. First, a shipment is created and marked as "open", meaning it is waiting to be assigned to a driver. Next, when a driver starts searching for a shipment to pick up, the algorithm searches if there exists a shipment within a reasonable distance for the driver. If there is, the shipment and driver are added to a batch (which is a group of nearby shipments and drivers). If no nearby batch exists, a new one is created. Once the batch reaches 100 shipments and drivers each, or 30 seconds have passed, the stable matching algorithm is performed on the drivers and shipments in the batch. This algorithm attempts to match each shipment with the best possible driver. The shipment\'s needs are given priority over drivers to ensure a good customer experience. Once the algorithm concludes, the shipments are assigned to drivers, and these drivers are given an offer to pick up the shipments. If they reject the offer, the algorithm repeats, while excluding that specific shipment.'}),(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"assets/sequence.png",alt:"Sequence Diagram",style:{width:"95%"}})]})}),(0,i.jsx)(c.Z,{sx:{width:"max-content",maxWidth:"60%",mb:5},children:(0,i.jsxs)(o.Z,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(h.Z,{variant:"h5",children:"Entity Relationship Diagram"}),(0,i.jsx)(h.Z,{children:"Our ER diagram shows how the tables in the database are structured.
